This is the autosplitter for Salt and Sanctuary. If you're here, I'm assuming you know what that means. To use the autosplitter, copy the DLL from the DLLs folder (LiveSplit.SaltSanctuary.dll) to your LiveSplit/Components folder, then add the autosplitter to your OBS layout (under the Control section). No other setup is needed, and after adding the component, you should see your timer automatically start when you venture forth on a new game.

Note that the autosplitter currently only works with All Bosses. Boss order is assumed to use the current route as of creating the autosplitter. The program splits on the final blow to each boss (or set of bosses when there are multiple), with the exception of the final boss (Nameless God), where it splits when you fall in the well.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on Twitch or Twitter (both Grimelios).
