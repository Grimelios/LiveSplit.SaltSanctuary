This is the autosplitter for Salt and Sanctuary All Bosses. If you're here, I'm assuming you know what that means. To use the autosplitter, just copy the DLL from the DLLs folder (LiveSplit.SaltSanctuary.dll), copy it to your LiveSplit/Components folder, and add the autosplitter to your OBS layout (under the Control section). No other setup is needed, and after adding the component, you should see your timer automatically start when you venture forth on a new game.

===

Note that the autosplitter currently only works with All Bosses, and not other categories (i.e. Any%). The program splits on the final blow to each boss (or set of bosses when there are multiple), with the exception of the final boss (Nameless God), where it splits when you fall in the well.

If you have any questions or anything, feel free to reach out to me on Twitch or Twitter (both Grimelios). Enjoy :)
